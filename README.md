# Basic R Resources

Welcome to the Tepper Data Analytics Club's Basic R Resources guide. As of right now, our goal is for this to help you get setup in R to 


## R Tutorials
* We really like the `swirl` package, which allows you to work through basic R syntax and programming right from RStudio. You learn R, in R! 
* [This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) on R Programming includes a bunch of lectures by Johns Hopkins' Roger Peng. It makes heavy use of `swirl`, but the lectures help explain some of the background and how to use the language.
* Datacamp also has a free [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) class that can get you up to speed fairly quickly.

## R Resources
RStudio has a number of excellent resources for the language:
* This [R Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf) walks you through a lot of basic R syntax and some key functions. This is especially helpful if you're familiar with another language like Python or C++ - R is a little different.
* RStudio has a [github repo](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets) full of cheatsheets for a number of commonly used R packages. If you're struggling with a package, try Googling "[package] cheatsheet" - 9 times out of 10, there's one for you.
* The [community forums](https://community.rstudio.com/) are not quite as active as StackExchange, but are a good source of information and can help you with specific problems.
